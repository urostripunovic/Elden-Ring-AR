# Elden Ring AR Calculator

An Elden Ring Calculator powered by ReactJS using images and values provided by [Elden Ring API](https://docs.eldenring.fanapis.com). The calculations are provided by [u/TarnishedSpreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/user/TarnishedSpreadsheet)'s [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLMP8BXDFdl1A1TbttVzdBr2Je-WNVQ9y6_HqIMymXI/copy), they also provided a [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WbKxdSTRYTg3NLoOPbsCQzWnU3dxx1i5oR3NldgnQ0o/edit). I used [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts) to extract the data from the google sheets. Link to [u/TarnishedSpreadsheet reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tbco46/elden_ring_weapon_calculator/) if you want to read it. And lastly here are other links to their [work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ybiI1WgyRs67kGklUXeroi58KDab2KsU_hKutBORiW0/edit#gid=1102808375)
